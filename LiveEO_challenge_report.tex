\section{Context}

\subsection{Goal}

The goal of this challenge is to implement a machine learning model able to predict the type of a geographic area (forest, water, urban...) from Sentinel-2 satellite image scenes.

\subsection{Resources}

The Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellite is equipped with a Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) which can provide 13 spectral bands ranging from the visible range to the shortwave infrared, plus additional band outputs.

%insert an array to explain the different bands
