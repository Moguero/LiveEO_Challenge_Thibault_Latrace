# LiveEO_Challenge_Thibault_Latrace
This repository aims at gathering all the ressources and works on the LiveEO Data Science challenge.
## Configuration
Firstly, clone this GitHub repository on your machine.
To install the environment I used for this challenge, you will need [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
In the anaconda prompt, navigate to the cloned repository and execute the following command line to reproduce the environment I used :

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then, open your IDE, open the notebook file and choose the kernel associated to the environment named *LiveEO_challenge_env*.

You can now run the notebook. You will find in it an incorporated report where I explain everthing about my approach of the problem.

I wish you a good reading !

Thibault
